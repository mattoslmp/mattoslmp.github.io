### AngioDB: [https://angiostrongylus.lad.pucrs.br/admin/](url) 

**AngioDB is database created during my Post-Doctorate at PUCRS in the Research group of Parasitology coordinated by Prof. Dr. Carlos Graeff-Teixeira and Dr. Alessandra Morassuti. The AngioDB was created with the collaboration of Dr Milene Guimar√£es (contact: milenepgj@gmail.com). The database stores the results of de novo assembly of the transcriptome of the parasite Angiostrongylus cantonensis, which is the main cause of eosinophilic meningitis in humans.**
